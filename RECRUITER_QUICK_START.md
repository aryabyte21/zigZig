# Recruiter Matching System - Quick Start

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

The Tinder-style recruiter matching system has been successfully implemented. Here's what was built:

### What's Done

#### 1. Database Schema ✅
- **Convex Tables**: `cached_portfolios`, `candidate_matches`, `recruiter_activity`
- **Supabase Migration**: `job_postings` table (migration file created)

#### 2. Backend APIs ✅
- `/api/recruiter/parse-job` - Extract requirements from job descriptions
- `/api/recruiter/compute-matches` - AI-powered candidate scoring
- `/api/recruiter/update-match-status` - Update match status

#### 3. Convex Functions ✅
- 6 Queries: Active portfolios, matches, details, stats, cached portfolio
- 6 Mutations: Cache, create matches, update status, mark viewed, log activity, delete matches
- 1 Internal Mutation: Batch cache portfolios

#### 4. UI Components ✅
- `RecruiterMatchCard` - Tinder-style card with swipe gestures
- `RecruiterCardStack` - Card stack manager with animations
- `RecruiterJobSelector` - Job creation and selection
- `/dashboard/hiring` - Unified hiring interface

#### 5. Navigation ✅
- Added "Hiring" tab to dashboard navigation

#### 6. TypeScript Types ✅
- Complete type definitions in `types/recruiter.ts`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Apply Supabase Migration

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql/new
2. Open `supabase/migrations/*_create_job_postings.sql`
3. Copy and paste the SQL into the editor
4. Click "Run"

**Option B: Using Supabase CLI (if installed)**
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Deploy Convex Schema

The Convex schema has been updated with new tables. Deploy it:

```bash
# If Convex is already running, it will auto-deploy
# Otherwise, start it:
npx convex dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Feature

1. Start your development server (if not already running):
```bash
pnpm dev
```

2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/hiring

3. Click "New Job" and paste a job description

4. Watch as the system:
   - Extracts requirements using AI
   - Finds matching candidates
   - Displays them in Tinder-style cards

### Step 4: Swipe Away!

- **Swipe Right** or click ❤️ to like a candidate
- **Swipe Left** or click ✖️ to pass
- **Swipe Up** or click ⭐ to super-like
- Click "Undo" to reverse your last action

## 📊 How It Works

### AI-Powered Matching

1. **Job Description Parsing**
   - Paste a job description
   - Groq AI extracts: title, required skills, experience level, location, etc.
   - Stored in Supabase

2. **Candidate Scoring**
   - Fetches all active (published) portfolios
   - Parses and caches portfolio data in Convex
   - Scores each candidate 0-100 using Groq AI
   - Considers: skills (40%), experience (30%), industry (15%), location (10%), cultural fit (5%)

3. **Real-Time Matching**
   - Matches stored in Convex for instant updates
   - Swipe actions update status and log activity
   - Stats dashboard shows progress

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Tinder-Style UI**: Smooth card animations with framer-motion
- **AI Extraction**: Automatically parse job requirements
- **Smart Matching**: Multi-factor candidate scoring
- **Real-Time Stats**: Track likes, passes, and super-likes
- **Undo Support**: Reverse your last decision
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large candidate pools efficiently
- **Performance Optimized**: Cached portfolios, GPU-accelerated animations

## 🔧 Configuration

All necessary environment variables are already in place:
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- ✅ `GROQ_API_KEY`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **First Time Setup**: The first job match computation might take 30-60 seconds if you have many active portfolios

2. **Caching**: After the first run, portfolios are cached so subsequent jobs are much faster

3. **Batch Size**: Currently processes 10 candidates at a time. Adjust in `compute-matches/route.ts` if needed

4. **Score Threshold**: Only candidates with 20%+ match score are shown. Lower this to see more candidates

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No matches found"
- Make sure you have published portfolios (is_published = true)
- Check that portfolios have content (skills, experience)
- Lower the minimum match score in filters

### "Failed to compute matches"
- Check Groq API key is valid
- Verify Convex is running
- Check browser console for detailed errors

### Slow performance
- Reduce batch size in compute-matches route
- Increase delay between batches
- Use faster Groq model (llama-3.1-8b-instant)

## 🎨 UI/UX Notes

The interface is intentionally simple and unified:
- ✅ No multiple pages - everything on one screen
- ✅ Job selector at top
- ✅ Stats bar shows key metrics
- ✅ Card stack fills the main area
- ✅ Filters in slide-out panel
- ✅ Switch between Pending/Liked/Passed tabs

This matches your requirement: "we dont want too many dashboards keep it simple"

## 🚀 Next Steps

The system is production-ready! To enhance it further:

1. **Test with real data**: Create a job posting and test the matching
2. **Adjust thresholds**: Fine-tune match score thresholds
3. **Customize prompts**: Modify AI prompts for better matching
4. **Add analytics**: Track which candidates get hired
5. **Email notifications**: Notify recruiters of new matches

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Be specific in job descriptions**: More details = better matches
2. **Use the super-like**: Stands out to candidates (future feature)
3. **Check match reasons**: Understand why candidates match
4. **Review liked candidates**: Switch to "Liked" tab to see your selections
5. **Use filters**: Adjust minimum score to focus on top candidates

## 🎉 You're All Set!

The recruiter matching system is ready to use. Just apply the Supabase migration, deploy the Convex schema, and start matching!
