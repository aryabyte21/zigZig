# Job Recommendation System Fixes

## Overview
Fixed and enhanced the job recommendation system to properly use the Exa AI API with active portfolio context.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Portfolio Integration
- **Added PortfolioParser import** to job recommendations API
- **Implemented parsed portfolio context** - Now uses the comprehensive portfolio parser to extract:
  - Skills (technical, frameworks, languages, tools, databases, cloud, soft skills)
  - Experience level and years
  - Preferred roles and industries
  - Company size preferences
  - Remote work preferences
  - Market profile analysis

### 2. Improved Exa AI Job Search
- **Enhanced job query building** - Now uses parsed portfolio data to build better search queries:
  - Uses preferred roles from portfolio analysis
  - Incorporates user's specific skill combinations
  - Better location and remote work preference handling
  
- **Better relevance scoring** - Added:
  - Preferred role matching (10% weight bonus)
  - Enhanced skill alignment with portfolio context
  - Portfolio-based experience level matching

### 3. Better Error Handling
- **Graceful API key handling** - Instead of throwing errors when EXA_API_KEY is missing:
  - Shows helpful error message with setup instructions
  - Provides fallback job recommendations
  - Continues to work even without API key configured
  
- **Fallback job recommendations** - Provides sample jobs when API is unavailable:
  - Uses user's filter preferences
  - Shows realistic job examples
  - Maintains UI functionality

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Active portfolio detection** - System now properly:
  - Finds the user's active/published portfolio
  - Parses the portfolio content with comprehensive analysis
  - Uses the parsed data for intelligent job matching
  
- **Better job matching** - Recommendations now consider:
  - User's actual skills from portfolio
  - Career preferences inferred from experience
  - Company size preferences
  - Remote work experience and preferences
